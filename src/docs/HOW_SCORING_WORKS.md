# How GeoTest.ai Scoring Works

## Understanding Your Scores

GeoTest.ai provides two main scores:
- **SEO Score**: Traditional search engine optimization (Google, Bing)
- **GEO Score**: Generative Engine Optimization (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini)

## The GEO Score Explained

Your GEO score (0-100) measures how well your website is optimized for AI search engines. Here's what we analyze:

### 1. **AI Visibility Check (30%)**
We query major AI platforms to see if they recognize your website:
- ✅ **Found**: The AI knows about your site and can describe it
- ⚠️ **Partially Found**: Limited or outdated information
- ❌ **Not Found**: The AI has no information about your site

**Important Note**: New websites (less than 6 months old) may not be found by AI platforms yet. This is normal! AI models are trained on data from specific time periods and update periodically.

### 2. **Content Structure Analysis (25%)**
AI platforms prefer well-structured, authoritative content:

**What We Check:**
- **Clear Headings**: Proper H1, H2, H3 hierarchy
- **Semantic HTML**: Use of `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, etc.
- **Structured Data**: Schema.org markup (FAQ, HowTo, Organization)
- **Content Depth**: Comprehensive coverage of topics (500+ words)
- **Answer Boxes**: Clear, concise answers to common questions

**Why It Matters**: AI systems extract information from well-structured content more accurately.

### 3. **Authority Signals (20%)**
AI platforms prioritize authoritative, trustworthy sources:

**Key Factors:**
- **Expertise Indicators**: Author bios, credentials, about pages
- **Citations**: Links to reputable sources
- **Fresh Content**: Recently updated information
- **Unique Insights**: Original research, data, or perspectives
- **Trust Signals**: SSL, privacy policy, contact information

### 4. **Technical Optimization (15%)**
Technical factors that affect AI crawling:

**We Evaluate:**
- **Page Speed**: Fast-loading pages (under 3 seconds)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design
- **Accessibility**: Alt text, ARIA labels
- **Meta Descriptions**: Clear, informative summaries
- **Open Graph Tags**: Social sharing optimization

### 5. **AI-Specific Optimization (10%)**
Special optimizations for AI platforms:

**Advanced Factors:**
- **AI Meta Tags**: Special tags for AI crawlers
- **Citable Content**: Statistics, facts, methodologies
- **Natural Language**: Conversational, question-answering format
- **Topic Clustering**: Related content grouped logically

## Scoring Interpretation

### Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Excellent - Your site is perfectly optimized for AI discovery
- **80-89**: Very Good - Minor improvements needed
- **70-79**: Good - Several optimization opportunities
- **60-69**: Fair - Significant improvements recommended
- **Below 60**: Needs Work - Major optimization required

## Why Some Sites Score High Despite Low AI Visibility

You might see a high GEO score even if AI platforms don't recognize your site yet. This happens because:

1. **New Website**: AI models have training cutoff dates
2. **Recent Changes**: AI platforms haven't re-indexed your site
3. **Optimization vs. Visibility**: Your site is well-optimized but not yet discovered

**Think of it this way**: A high GEO score means your site is "AI-ready" - when AI platforms next update their knowledge, well-optimized sites are more likely to be included and ranked prominently.

## How to Improve Your GEO Score

### Quick Wins (Can improve score by 10-20 points):
1. Add comprehensive FAQ sections with schema markup
2. Include author information and expertise indicators
3. Improve content structure with clear headings
4. Add semantic HTML5 elements

2. Add structured data for your content type
3. Build citations and link to authoritative sources
4. Improve page load speed to under 2 seconds
5. Implement proper meta tags and Open Graph data

### Long-term Strategy (For 90+ scores):

2. Get cited by other authoritative websites
3. Maintain fresh, updated content
4. Build a comprehensive content hub
5. Engage with AI platforms through their tools/APIs

## The Difference Between SEO and GEO

### Traditional SEO:
- Focuses on keywords and backlinks
- Optimizes for search ranking algorithms
- Emphasizes page authority and domain strength
- Uses exact-match keywords

### GEO (Generative Engine Optimization):
- Focuses on comprehensive, authoritative content
- Optimizes for information extraction
- Emphasizes expertise and trustworthiness
- Uses natural language and context

## Remember: Patience is Key

AI platforms update their knowledge bases at different rates:
- **Perplexity**: Can find new content within days (uses web search)
- **ChatGPT/Claude**: Updated periodically with new training data
- **Gemini**: Regular updates aligned with Google's index

Even with a perfect GEO score, it may take 2-6 months for new sites to appear in AI search results. Focus on creating excellent, authoritative content, and the AI visibility will follow!
