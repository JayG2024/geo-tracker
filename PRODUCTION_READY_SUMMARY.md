```

### 2. **Deploy Changes**
```bash

```

### 3. **Post-Deployment Steps**

## üìä Expected Performance

### When Testing GeoTest.ai on Itself:

### For Other Sites:

- Clear explanations of what needs improvement

## üîê Security Considerations

### Public Access (Current State)

2. **Add Redis for rate limiting** (better than in-memory)
3. **Enable Vercel DDoS protection** (automatic with Pro plan)
4. **Monitor with Vercel Analytics**
5. **Set up error tracking** (Sentry already configured)
