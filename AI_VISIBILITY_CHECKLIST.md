# AI Search Engine Visibility Checklist for GeoTest.ai

## Current Status
- Site URL: https://www.geotest.ai
- Domain Age: Relatively new (registered 2024)
- AI Knowledge Cutoffs: Most AI models don't know about sites created after their training dates

## Steps to Get Indexed by AI Search Engines

### 1. **Immediate Actions** âœ“
- [x] Make site crawlable with proper robots.txt
- [x] Add AI-specific meta tags
- [x] Implement structured data (Schema.org)
- [x] Create comprehensive sitemap

### 2. **Content Strategy for AI Discovery**
- [ ] Create authoritative, citable content about GEO/AI SEO
- [ ] Publish thought leadership articles
- [ ] Get mentioned in industry publications
- [ ] Create unique research or tools that AIs will reference

### 3. **Authority Building**
- [ ] Get listed in relevant directories
- [ ] Obtain backlinks from established sites
- [ ] Submit to AI-focused directories and lists
- [ ] Create Wikipedia-worthy content (AIs heavily reference Wikipedia)

### 4. **Direct Submission Methods**
- [ ] Submit to Bing (Perplexity uses Bing's index)
- [ ] Ensure Google indexing (many AIs reference Google's data)
- [ ] Create profiles on major platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] Submit to AI tool directories

### 5. **Testing Your Progress**
- Use your own tool to test visibility over time
- Current AI models may not know about the site yet
- Future model updates will include newer data
- Monitor when each AI platform updates their knowledge base

## Expected Timeline
- **Google/Bing Indexing**: 1-2 weeks after submission
- **AI Model Awareness**: Varies by platform
  - Perplexity: Often within weeks (uses live web search)
  - ChatGPT: Depends on model updates (monthly/quarterly)
  - Claude: Major model updates (less frequent)
  - Gemini: Regular updates with Google's index

## Note on Testing Your Own Site
When GeoTest.ai tests itself, it may show low AI visibility initially because:
1. The domain is new
2. AI models have training cutoffs before the site existed
3. It takes time for AI platforms to discover and index new sites

This is normal and expected for new domains. The tool is working correctly - it's just that the AIs don't know about the site yet!
